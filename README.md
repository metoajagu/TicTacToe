A terminal based TicTacToe game coded in python

[**How to Download and Play**]

1. Make a clone of this repository on your computer.
2. Ensure you have anaconda and python downloaded on your device
3. In your terminal (I am on Mac so press Space and Command to Search Terminal) go to the directory that holds the tictactoe.py file.
4. Run the tictactoe.py file and you will be greeted by the display of the game in your command terminal [**Warning: The program isn't very nice and will most insult you**]

5. To begin the game pick a number between 1 to 10 to see if you get to go first [Be X's and Computer O's] or if the computer gets to go first [Computer is X's and you will be O's] Here is an example of if you go first:

And if you lose you will see this not so nice message:

6. Play the game by entering in a number that corresponds to a grid position on the play board:

7. Once a row, column or diagonal is filled with a marker the program declares there is a winner:

[**Lessons and Techniques I Took Away:**]

This project helped me understand the use of Python objects and how to correctly set up inherited classes and class functions with the use of 'self'. 

I also learned the use of the input method in Python and how to use the user's input to place in your code.

Understanding how Python runs code in the main command terminal by using conditionals with checking __name__ is equal to '__name__. I was able to use this call the specific objects and there functions to run to play the TicTacToe game

I also learned the impact of helper functions and how to use them in other especially pertaining to object classes. A big mistake I found myself making at times was forget to use self when calling functions in other functions or just forgetting to pass in 'self' in my function parameters and that really showed me the importance of self as whole and using defined functions and values in an object class. 

Another important thing I took away was how to incorporate a game logic into one function, my play_tictactoe() function held all the logic for playing the game. Upon finishing this program I understood the importance of proper logic whilst coding it, what specific functions to call at specific times and where the code was not working because of a specific function call, etc.



[**Bugs/Things to Fix**]

There still exist some bugs in the program:

- For when you are O's, the program still acts as O's and plays as O's. I still have to fix this bug and plan to in the future and update this READ.md
- The game doesn't reset to play again, you still have to rerun the whole file to play again, this is something I have to go in and logically fix and will do so in the coming future.


Overall I Hope You Enjoy the Game for What it is Right Now...
And Don't Let the Program Get to You, It's Just a Little Competitive.
